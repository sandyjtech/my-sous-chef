# MY SOUS CHEF

![My SOUS CHEF](https://github.com/arbitrary-berry/my-sous-chef/blob/main/My%20Sous%20Chef%20demo.mov)

## Introduction

This is an app for hungry cooks who can't decide what to make. Deciding what to eat every day can sometimes tip the scales into decision fatigue, and your brain doesn't have the capacity to make another decision. Let this app make the decision for you. Maybe you're planning what to get at the grocery store for the week and have to come up with a week's worth of meals. Or you have time to go to the store to get ingredients and can't think of anything you want to make or eat. 

If you don't like the recipe, feel free to click on the "Another Recipe" button.

### As a user I can:

* Get a random recipe generated by clicking on the book.

* See the randomly generated recipe with the recipe name, ingredient list, instructions, and image.

* If I don't like the recipe shown I can click on the "Another Recipe" button to generate a different recipe.

* Leave a review of the recipe.

## Roadmap

Ideas for future releases:

- Add more accessibility by adding a checkbox and filtering for Vegetarian, Vegan, Dairy-Free, and Gluten-Free. *See below for keys*
- Have the review form preload the name of the recipe you're reviewing.
